        <p><em>Design ASCII art generators that insult your coding style constructively.</em></p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Ascii project aims to create a unique tool that generates ASCII art while simultaneously providing humorous and constructive feedback on coding style. It's a blend of artistic expression and code quality improvement, delivered with a playful twist.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <p>As a new project, Ascii is currently in its conceptual phase. The envisioned core features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An engine to analyze code and identify stylistic patterns.</li>
            <li>A system for generating ASCII art based on various inputs.</li>
            <li>A curated library of "constructive insults" linked to coding anti-patterns.</li>
            <li>A command-line interface for ease of use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of Ascii</h2>
        <p>The future of Ascii is to become a beloved (and slightly feared) companion for developers. Future developments may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integration with various IDEs and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
            <li>Expansion of ASCII art styles and themes.</li>
            <li>A community-driven platform for submitting and rating new insults and art.</li>
            <li>Advanced code analysis capabilities for more nuanced feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project's progress and direction will be tracked through the issues in this repository.</p>
